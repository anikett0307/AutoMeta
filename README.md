# AutoMeta: Adaptive Meta-Learning Framework for Dynamic Task Shifts

AutoMeta is a meta-learning framework designed for handling dynamic task shifts in medical image classification.  
The system integrates Bayesian Online Change Point Detection (BOCPD), a memory bank mechanism, and contrastive learning on top of an extended MAML architecture.
